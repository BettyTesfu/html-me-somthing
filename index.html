					<h2>My Career</h2>
					<p>I worked as Design Engineer, Field Engineer and Project manager with As. Be.Co., URS and AECOM. I am currently working with Missouri Department of Transportation as a Traffic Engineer. I enjoy my work. But I always had an interest to learn computer programing. When I heard about the Launch code opportunity, I though it is such a golden opportunity to jump on. Here I am taking the challenge to learn LC101.</p>

					<h2>My Hobby</h2>
					<p>I like travelling to new places and visiting families and friends .  One of my favorite places I visit is Orlando. My husband and I went to Orlando and visited Holy Land Experience. It is a  Christian-based theme park in Orlando, Florida. The park recreates the architecture and themes of the ancient city of Jerusalem in 1st-century Judea.</p>
